			services over the Internet. These services are broadly divided into three categories: Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and 
			Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).  A cloud service has three distinct characteristics that differentiate it from traditional hosting. It is sold on demand, typically

			IT trends, because it's all about saving money and simplifying the lives of users. In cloud computing, large pools of computer systems share an IT infrastructure, enabling 
			products, services and solutions to be accessed and consumed in real-time over the Internet, typically via a subscription model. Cloud computing made it onto Gartner's Hype Cycle 
			Special Report for 2009. The research firm has pointed out that companies are still very interested in learning more about how to consume IT services in the most cost-effective
